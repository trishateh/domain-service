# APE Domain Service on Polygon L2

I build an Ape Name Service on Polygon L2 using Solidity, Hardhat, Node.js, JavaScipt, React, HTML and CSS.

Mint your own .ape domains and record information about your apes on the blockchain! How cool is that?!

Not only that, click on the link to view your .ape domain NFTs on Open Sea.

Want to change your ape's information? Fret not, click on the edit button and to begin editing.
