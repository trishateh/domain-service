# APE Domain Service on Polygon L2

I build an Ape Name Service on Polygon L2 using Solidity, Hardhat, Node.js, JavaScipt, React, HTML and CSS.

Mint your own .ape domains and record information about your apes on the blockchain! How cool is that?!

Not only that, click on the link to view your .ape domain NFTs on Open Sea.

Want to change your ape's information? Fret not, click on the edit button and to begin editing.

## Running React on Repl.it

[React](https://reactjs.org/) is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is a blazing fast frontend build tool that includes features like Hot Module Reloading (HMR), optimized builds, and TypeScript support out of the box.

Using the two in conjunction is one of the fastest ways to build a web app.

### Getting Started
- Hit run
- Edit [App.jsx](#src/App.jsx) and watch it live update!

By default, Replit runs the `dev` script, but you can configure it by changing the `run` field in the `.replit` file.
